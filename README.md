# KAOS

King's Adolescent Outreach Service launched in 2018.
It was created to meet the needs of young people aged 16-19y who were admitted under adult teams to adult wards. Although they got excellent medical and surgical care, their non-medical needs were often not met. KAOS use youth workers to explore a psychosocial history and identify need / signpost to services.

## KAOS app
To provide young people in hospital with information about their care, this app was devised. It is a PWA, because it is easy to keep up to date without needing approval from the App Store or Google Play, is accessible on any phone through the webbrowser.

## Clinician Roster
The youth workers are overseen by volunteer clinicians, usually consultants across the organisation providing clinical advice and guidance to the youth workers. The app has a roster built in, with an authentication layer.
The backend and authentication is provided by Google Firebase.

The PWA is provided by [Ionic 5](https://ionicframework.com/blog/announcing-ionic-5/) and (Angular 9)[https://angular.io/].
