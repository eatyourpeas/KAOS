        Our bodies, health conditions and procedures are all really complex. It’s
        completely normal to have lots of questions, so don’t hold back! It’s good to ask questions about
        your health and be involved with your care. In first instance, always ask one of your medical team if
        you don’t understand something and if they can’t help you, ask them who might be able to talk to
        you.

        There are also useful digital resources – try <a href="https://nhsgo.uk/">NHS Go</a>, a
        free health app designed specifically for young people or the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Pages/hub.aspx">NHS A-Z of health conditions</a> and
        treatments. Be aware that some online health sites and forums are less reliable and, in some cases, might not helpful or accurate. Always ask your
        medical team on the ward if you are worried or have questions.
