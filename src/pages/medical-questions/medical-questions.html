  <p>Our bodies, health conditions and procedures are all really complex. It’s
completely normal to have lots of questions, so don’t hold back! It’s good to ask questions about
your health and be involved with your care. In first instance, always ask one of your medical team if
you don’t understand something and if they can’t help you, ask them who might be able to talk to
you. There are also useful digital resources – try the NHS go app (include link https://nhsgo.uk/ ), a
free health app designed specifically for young people or the NHS A-Z of health conditions and
treatments at https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Pages/hub.aspx . Be aware that some online health
sites and forums are less reliable and, in some cases, might not helpful or accurate. Always ask your
medical team on the ward if you are worried or have questions.
If you live or go to school in Lambeth and Southwark and you’re between the ages of 11-19, you can
text ‘ChatHealth’ for free and they’ll message you back confidential health advice and support on</p>
<a href="07507332 150">07507332 150</a><p>. This service operates 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday and the school nurse will get
back to you within 24 hours.
Other than the above, it’s always advisable to go run through any medical questions with your local
GP. The Well Centre https://www.thewellcentre.org/ is a brilliant youth health centre where you can
see a youth worker, counsellor and GP in a safe and relaxed space. You can call ahead on 0208 473
1581 to book an appointment or come along to one their ‘drop-ins’ on Monday, Wednesday and
Thursdays.</p>
