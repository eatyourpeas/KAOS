    <ion-row>
      <h4>Who Are We?</h4>

    </ion-row>
    <ion-row>
      <h4>What Do We Do?</h4>
        <p>We are here for you during your stay in the hospital. You already have a medical and nursing team looking after your condition. We are there to make sure everything else is covered. We aim to be an advocate for your care. If you feel there is something that is bothering you during your stay, or that you are not being heard then please talk to us about it. We can't help you, we will try and signpost you to the right people who can.</p>
    </ion-row>
    <ion-row>
      <h4>Why?</h4>
        <p>We realise that being in hospital is not fun for anyone, especially young people.  We realised people feel out of place in between paediatric and adult care - we are here to bridge that gap.</p>
    </ion-row>
    <ion-row>
      <h4>How do I find you?</h4>
        <p>No need! We will come and find you during your stay. If you want to make contact ask your nurse to give us a call or find our contacts on the contacts page.</p>
