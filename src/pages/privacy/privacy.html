  <p>When you’re on a hospital ward, having a sense of privacy and dignity is important. You should have
the option of a curtain or a door to your bed and anyone entering is required to ask permission.
Most wards have a ‘Quiet’ or ‘Private’ room – if you’d feel more comfortable having a potentially
sensitive conversation in one of these spaces, ask your medical team. Don’t just sit there feeling
uncomfortable, speak up and ask!
King’s has its own Security Department that work 24 hours a day, seven days a week to keep
everyone at the hospital safe and secure. In order to do so, they patrol the hospital and its grounds,
entrances and exits, and monitor CCTV.</p>
<p>Top tips to keep yourself safe:</p>
<li>Only bring essential items to the hospital</li>
<li>Protect your personal belongings</li>
<li>Confirm the identity of staff not wearing an ID card</li>
<li>Don’t give access to strangers through secure doors</li>
<li>Report anything that doesn’t look right to staff</li>
