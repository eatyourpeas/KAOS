        When you’re on a hospital ward, having a sense of privacy and dignity is important. You should have
        the option of a curtain or a door to your bed and anyone entering is required to ask permission.
        Most wards have a ‘Quiet’ or ‘Private’ room – if you’d feel more comfortable having a potentially
        sensitive conversation in one of these spaces, ask your medical team. Don’t just sit there feeling
        uncomfortable, speak up and ask!
