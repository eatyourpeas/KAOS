  <p>Medical staff should always explain the risks and benefits of your
treatment every step of the way. In some cases, they may ask you to confirm verbally or by writing
that you are happy to proceed with certain procedures. It is important that you fully understand and
feel comfortable before making a decision. It’s also a good idea to discuss this with your friends and
family.
King’s hospital staff will collect your personal details and maintain records of your medical condition
and treatments to help provide you with the best care possible and in case you need treatment in
the future. Your medical information is stored securely and only shared with those involved in your
care. You should be consulted if your information will be shared with any other organisations or
professionals. The only time where this might not apply is when you disclose a piece of information
that indicates that you or someone else might be at serious risk of harm. If you want to know more
