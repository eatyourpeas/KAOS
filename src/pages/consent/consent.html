        Medical staff should always explain the risks and benefits of your
        treatment every step of the way. In some cases, they may ask you to confirm verbally or by writing
        that you are happy to proceed with certain procedures. It is important that you fully understand and
        feel comfortable before making a decision. It’s also a good idea to discuss this with your friends and
        family.

        If you are over 16y, you can sign consent forms for medical/surgical procedures and treatments without your parents or carers. If you are under 16y, the medical staff may
        need to decide if you are 'Gillick' Compentent - that is, mature enough to understand the risks of the treatment or procedure, weigh them up and explain them back.
        Gillick competence only relates to your ability to <i>consent</i> to treatment, not to <i>refuse</i> it. For more information read <a href="https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-protection-system/legal-definition-child-rights-law/gillick-competency-fraser-guidelines/">here</a>.

        King’s hospital staff will collect your personal details and maintain records of your medical condition
        and treatments to help provide you with the best care possible and in case you need treatment in
        the future. Your medical information is stored securely and only shared with those involved in your
        care. You should be consulted if your information will be shared with any other organisations or
        professionals. The only time where this might not apply is when you disclose a piece of information
        that indicates that you or someone else might be at serious risk of harm.
