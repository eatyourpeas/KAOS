        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england">The NHS Constitution</a> sets out the principles and values of the NHS and the rights and
        responsibilities of patients and staff. Hospitals are busy and stressful places, but it’s important to
        remember that our staff are here to help you so they expect to be treated with respect – any abuse
        or violence towards staff is unacceptable.

      <div class="card-content-text">
        Under the NHS Constitution, patients have a right to start consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks
        from referral where clinically appropriate and the patient wishes to be treated within 18 weeks.
        Where this is not possible, the NHS must take all reasonable steps to offer the patient a quicker
        appointment at a range of alternative providers if they request this.

      <div class="card-content-text">
        It is important that you try your best to keep to GP and hospital appointments, or if you have to
        cancel, making staff aware of this in good time is helpful. King’s also benefits from your feedback,
        both positive and negative about the treatment you’ve received. The easiest way to do this is <a href="https://www.kch.nhs.uk/about/how-are-we-doing">online</a>.
        Another good source of information, support and assistance is through PALS (Patient Advice and Liaison Service). You can get in touch
        with them on <a href="tel:+442032993601">020 3299 3601</a>, via <a href="mail:kch-tr.PALS@nhs.net">email</a> or through their online form.
