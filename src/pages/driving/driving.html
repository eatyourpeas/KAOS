  <p>King&#39;s is in the residential area of Camberwell, South London and is not
within the Congestion Charge zone. The hospital has very limited parking space. If you can get here
by public transport, then we suggest that you explore these options. There are a small number of
short-term parking spaces where you can drop off and collect patients outside the Golden Jubilee
Wing and Hambleden Wing. There are also 20 marked parking spaces across the site for drivers who
are registered disabled and have a valid blue badge. There is no charge for parking in these
spaces. Disabled drivers can also use the main car park, but they must pay the usual parking charge.
Parking is charged per hour or part hour, cash only. You must pay before you leave the car park. The
charges for the car park are as follows: 7am - 10pm: £2.50 per hour for the first two hours or part
hour. Then £2 per hour or part hour. 10pm - 7am: £2 for the whole period.
Public transport options are varied – the following buses all serve the hospital: 35, 40, 42, 45, 68, 176
(24-hour), 185, 345 (24-hour), 468, 484, N35, N68. The hospital is a five-minute walk to Denmark Hill
Station and is also close to Loughborough Junction Station.
The closest petrol stations are: Jet Petrol Station (42 Hinton Road SE24 0HJ), Applegreen Camberwell
(96-106 Camberwell Road, SE5 0EG), Tesco Brixton Express (330 Brixton Road, SW9 8QQ), Morrisons
Peckham (Aylesham Centre, SE15 1SF), Tesco Tulse Hill (19 Tulse Hill, SW2 2QB).</p>
