        King&#39;s is in the residential area of Camberwell, South London and is not
        within the Congestion Charge zone. The hospital has very limited parking space. If you can get here
        by public transport, then we suggest that you explore these options. There are a small number of
        short-term parking spaces where you can drop off and collect patients outside the Golden Jubilee
        Wing and Hambleden Wing. There are also 20 marked parking spaces across the site for drivers who
        are registered disabled and have a valid blue badge. There is no charge for parking in these
        spaces. Disabled drivers can also use the main car park, but they must pay the usual parking charge.
        Parking is charged per hour or part hour, cash only. You must pay before you leave the car park. The
        charges for the car park are as follows:
