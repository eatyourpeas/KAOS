          Sexuality and sexual orientation is about who you are physically and emotionally attracted to. It’s also important to say that who you are attracted to in these ways can
          change over time. There are lots of different types of sexual orientation and there’s no such thing as
          a ‘normal sexuality’. Some people know when they’re very young who they fancy. For other people,
          it’s not so simple and it can take a while to work out.

          People whose sexuality is something other than straight are often called LGB (short for lesbian, gay
          or bisexual) or LGBT – the ‘T’ stands for transgender (a gender identity rather than an orientation).
          But there are many more different kinds of sexuality.

          Gender identity is a way to describe how you feel about your gender. Everyone has a gender
          identity and expresses their gender in a unique and personal way. This could be through the clothes
          you wear, the way you stand, the interests you have. Some people know from a young age that their
          gender identity doesn’t feel the same as what they were assigned at birth, and some people may
          take a while to work out their gender identity. This is completely fine, everyone is unique.
          Sadly, sexual bullying based on a person’s sexuality and gender is still common. This is totally
          unacceptable. There are a number of brilliant organisations that work to help young people through
          what can be a difficult journey, a few are listed here:
