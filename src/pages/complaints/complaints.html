  <p>If you have concerns and you are on a ward, the best person to speak to is the ward manager of the
senior nurse on duty. If you are an outpatient, you should ask for help at reception or approach a
member of staff in a department who will try and put things right as soon as they can. In the event
that you are not satisfied with the hospital staff’s response, you can contact PALS (Patient Advice
and Liaison Service) on 020 3299 3601 who will try and help to resolve your problem and provide
useful information. If they cannot deal with your concern, you have the option of making a formal
complaint, which can be made by doing the following:
 Calling call the Complaints Office on 020 3299 3209
 Completing this online form
 Emailing kch-tr.patientcomplaints@nhs.net
 Writing a letter to the Complaints Office at:
Complaints Office
King&#39;s College Hospital
