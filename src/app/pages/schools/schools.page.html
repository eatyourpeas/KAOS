          If you are still in education or not, it’s never too late to start learning! Even if you have been out of
          education for a long time and didn’t get any qualifications, there are lots of options available to you.
          Great local options for colleges include Lambeth College, Lewisham Southwark College, Bromley
          College and Croydon College.

          Apprenticeships, that combine work and training, are also a popular option. They offer you the
          opportunity to ‘earn while you learn’. A full list of apprenticeships can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/further-education-skills/apprenticeships">here</a>.

          There has also been an on-site education service for young people at King’s for over 30 years. The
          King’s College Hospital Schoolroom provides a safe, friendly and welcoming environment. The
          schoolroom is open every weekday, term time only, to school age pupils between 4 and 17 years.
          They aim to strike a balance of academic and creative activities and encourage each child to take
          their work home or back to their mainstream school. If you’d like to get involved or visit the
          Schoolroom, call <a href="tel:+442032994402">020 3299 4402</a> or ask the KAOS Youth Worker for more information. The
          Schoolroom teachers can also come to you!
