          If you are an outpatient, you should ask for help at reception or approach a
          member of staff in a department who will try and put things right as soon as they can. In the event
          that you are not satisfied with the hospital staff’s response, you can contact PALS (Patient Advice

          useful information. If they cannot deal with your concern, you have the option of making a formal
          complaint, which can be made by doing the following:
